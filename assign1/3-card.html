      <p>Victoria, a young white cat, is dropped in the streets of London by her owner in the middle of the night. 
        The alley cats witnessing this introduce themselves to her as the "Jellicles". 
        Two toms, meek magician Mr. Mistoffelees who develops a crush on Victoria and the loyal Munkustrap,
        and two queens, the snooty Cassandra and Demeter, take Victoria under their wing and show her the world of 
        the Jellicles as they hype up the Jellicle Ball, an annual ceremony where cats compete for the chance to go 
        to the Heaviside Layer and be granted a new life. </p>
